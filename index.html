            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.<br>Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.</li>
            </ul>

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript is a versatile programming language commonly used for web development. It allows you to create interactive web pages and build web applications. JavaScript is often used alongside HTML and CSS to add functionality to websites.</p>
            <p>Java, on the other hand, is a high-level, object-oriented programming language. It is known for its platform independence, making it suitable for various applications, including web development, mobile app development, and enterprise software.</p>

            <p>JavaScript code is typically embedded within HTML files and executed by web browsers. Here are some basic concepts:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Variables and Data Types</li>
                <li>Functions and Control Flow</li>
                <li>DOM Manipulation</li>
                <li>Events and Event Handling</li>
                <li>AJAX and Asynchronous Programming</li>

            <header>Java Fundamentals</header>
            <p>Java is a statically-typed language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Key concepts include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Classes and Objects</li>
                <li>Inheritance and Polymorphism</li>
                <li>Exception Handling</li>
                <li>Java APIs (e.g., Collections, IO)</li>
                <li>Multi-threading</li>
            </ul>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <p>You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:<br><br>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
            <code>var x = 42.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.<br><br>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
            <code>x = 42.</code>
            <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.<br><br>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
            <code>let y = 13.</code>
            <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
            <p>Also, when you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.</p>
            <p>JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.</p>
            <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5</code>
            <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
            <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined</code>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
            <header>Global variables</header>
            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
            <p>Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as parent.phoneNumber. </p>
